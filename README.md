# Kaggle Projects & Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to my Kaggle Projects repository! This is a collection of exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks and mini-projects based on diverse real-world datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Each notebook dives into a specific dataset, exploring patterns, visualizing insights, and performing light preprocessing and feature engineering.
